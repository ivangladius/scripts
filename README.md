### useful scripts and utilities for linux
### just make executable and put to $PATH 

# .bashrc
bash config
# .zshrc
zsh config
# monitor.sh
manage external monitor and position with *rofi*
# fastpdf.sh
Open pdf anywhere in the home directory with *rofi* and *evince* (super cool, chance evince with any pdf viewer)
# gnome_remove_all_keys.py
remove all gnome keybinds.
why? you cannot overrwrite gnome keybindings from the GUI settings menu.
log in and out after running this script to remove all keys and then you can set your own.
